# neurospirituality-lab.github.io

This is a static HTML/CSS/JS website for the Neurospirituality Lab (PI: Michael Ferguson, PhD), initially created by Joseph Turner. 

Currently, there are four main pages:
- Home
- People
- Research
- Contact
- Resources

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and is HTML/CSS/JS, no server-side code nor jekyll. 

**Next Steps**
- Hosting group-level data form our studies (NiFTI, etc)?
- Add a page for news? (do we have enough news to warrant this?)
- Add a page specifically for the lab's publications? (we could use mfergusons's google scholar for this instead)
- Page for people interested in participating in our studies?

**Color Palette**
- `#003B6D` - Dark Blue
- `#6699CC` - Light Blue
- `#fafbff` Off White
- `#BDBDBD` - Light Grey
- `#676767` - Dark Grey

**Assets**
- `assets/figures/` - random figures from MFerguson's papers that I thought looked cool
- `assets/logos/` - logos for the lab, university, etc
- `assets/people/` - headshots of lab members
- `https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/1066202474/9102088214` - video of a brain rendering that I thought looked cool (I made from MFerguson's amnesia NIFTI data)
